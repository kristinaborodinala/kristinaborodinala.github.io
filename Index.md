My name is Kristina Borodina. I am a CSUF Computer Science Major, class of 2029 

My favorite labs of the CPSC 120 course 

Lab 1 
Lab 1 is one of my favorite labs because it gave 
a great introduction to the lab portion of the course. 
This lab focused more on getting familiar with GitHub, than the 
actual code, and I was able to do it pretty swiftly with a few 
complications. Although I scored low on the lab, it definitely prepared 
me for what was to come in the, then, future of the course, and I really 
understood, after practicing it on my own, how the terminal and Githib works 

Lab 5 
Lab 5 primarily focused on the "make" command, and from my memory, was the lab 
that also focused on testing the code for errors. This lab marks one of my favorites 
because of it's challenging nature. It was different, but it set out a great pathway 
for further code we have programmed. It definitely was a big change from the previous Clang++ command 
we used in the course 

Lab 12 
Lab 12 was our most recent lab, but it was by far the most interesting of all. 
Throughout the course, I was always wondering how programming could form images and animation, 
as it seemed to be primarily based on outputting letters and numbers. This lab was 
quite challenging, but it was extraordinarily interesting to me how the same code I've used before 
could transform into a GIF. I was very shocked when my teammate and I first downloaded the file we 
had coded on our own and received the output of an animation. It shows how powerful computers can be and 
how coding is a form of art
